Akash Magoon and I created a platform for conducting technical interviews called HireFlock! It allows interviewers to interact with candidates and assess their skills as they work through interview questions by providing support for video chat, syntax highlighting for 142 languages, and compiling/running for 16 of the most popular languages. It is currently completely free to sign up and use, however you can also start an interview without creating an account at all.

Hey! I'm up against a deadline, and very torn between two job offers, so I would really appreciate your input!
So, a little bit about myself: 
- I just graduated in June, and I've been looking for fulltime jobs in Montreal since. 
- I'm not from here, so unless I have a job that's able to support me financially, I'm going back to Egypt, and career-wise it isn't the best for Software Engineers so I'm trying to avoid that as much as possible. 
The search wasn't going very well, so in the midst of it, I saw a posting for an internship at Autodesk here, and I applied for it. I also applied for a Software Eng job at an established Montreal-based start-up (a couple of years old).
Dilemma: 
-> I got the internship at Autodesk, for 3 months. 
(-) Low intern salary. 
(-) No guarantees that I will get hired at the end of the term. 
(+) But big company name, will look better on CV.
(+) Better location
(-) Working/learning tailored towards Autodesk software, maybe? 
-> I got the Full-time job at the start-up.
(+) Proper salary 
(+) Job stability. 
(-) Not well-known company
(-) Longer commute. 
(+) Maybe more opportunities to learn? 
So I've spoken to a lot of my friends in the Software Industry and they each have different opinions:
- some think I should go for the startup for more learning experience. They think that at Autodesk, the learning will be using frameworks and whatnot.
- some think I should take the risk and go for Autodesk because the company name will open more doors for me in the future. 
I really would deeply deeply appreciate any input you have on this.",Aliaa Moharram,,status,,2017-08-30 20:12:42,2,15,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't know how regex is implemented (esp. in Python).

I have to say I quite agree with this article in a number of ways. Scrum creates this ""status meeting"" that makes everyone feel like they're under constant surveillance and everyday have to justify their decisions. (one reason managers should not be part of a scrum team). 

 It emphasizes putting out fires rather than building things the right way to begin with: case in point would you ever cross a bridge built with a scrum methodology or would you want Engineers to properly design it from start to finish?

I can tell you....it always feels like we're putting out fires and are constantly in ""emergency mode"" with my team, and I think the ""Agile"" mentality is to blame. We've sacrificed good, sound engineering and replaced it with ""rapid prototyping"" and software that is constantly re-invented.

My litmus test: would you make a pacemaker with agile methodologies? Would you trust your life to a ""rapid prototype"" of a heart and lungs machine? No? What about the software your bank uses to keep your information secure? Would you accept a ""rapid prototype"" of that? How about autopilot software on a plane? Air traffic control software? The systems that control traffic lights? OS kernels? These are countless examples ot when you need the software to be dependable and reliable every time. A ""rapid prototype""  simply won't do. 

Rapid prototyping is fine if you're in the alpha and beta stages. But when management it comes to code you're shipping.....it should be properly engineered, not patches and bug fixes thrown into a proof of concept.

There's been a lot of chatter about some of the news regarding diversity and inclusion (or lack of) in the industry right now.

Long story short: everyone should have the opportunity to be technical if they want to. Everyone can contribute technically, and maybe even surprise you with some ideas you hadn't heard before. Because the industry is so biased at times, events and opportunities targeting minority groups in the field are made so that people can have a community and a chance that they might not otherwise have. I encourage you to accept this, and welcome people into this wacky field of ours.

In HH, we want to be an inclusive, awesome role model for the industry, and a positive glimpse into what the tech industry can become. This isn't political, this is being a kind group of people, welcoming and accepting of anyone willing to try.

I am thinking about developing an app that helps and advises students during the college admissions process. It can be a really stressful and confusing time for many young adults, so I feel that developing such a tool would be valuable. 
I am thinking that app would allow students to connect with either current college students, college advisors/counselors, or anyone that has experienced the overwhelming nature of the admissions process.

1.) What do you think about the idea? Is it something you would use?

2.) What features do you think would be necessary for the app?

3.) Would you (or your parents) be willing to pay a small fee for the app to receive more 1 on 1 personalized coaching (optional) ?

So I've never been to a hackathon before and am thinking about applying for one in January. Most of my knowledge are in web development. But I observed that Machine Learning has become more and more common in the industry and hackathons. Hence, I have a small concern:

Is web app (without ML or anything the like) still trending in hackathons?

Many thanks!

P.S: Sorry if this concern sounds ""nooby"". But as I said, I haven't gone to a hackathon before. So I don't have much experience. And I also don't have much knowledge in ML.",William To,,status,,2017-08-28 20:13:58,2,10,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am really ambitious and would want to work in abroad in the future (hopefully I wonna try looking for a job abroad after working <= 1 here in PH. Here are my options for now.
1) Startup where I could contribute significantly ASAP but most of the startups here is ""learn by doing"" and have minimal training but I could ask the senior engineers if I have problems. Most of the startups I applied/got an interview uses open-source tech. Some of them almost do everything from Software Eng'g to PenTesting to Blockchain etc.

2) Big Company where there is a more strict and formal training but I do not know if I could contribute much given a short amount of time. Work given to me is very specific.

3) Be a Research Assistant in my Univ. Our CompSci and EEE Institute have projects that collab with UC Berkeley/San Diego etc. but I think it would be ""learn by doing"" and I could consult the Profs. some time.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45859960/complex-django-filtering-where-filter-argument-involves-comparing-two-different

Attempt to improve earlier question (disclaimer: I'm a novice)

In my Django based quiz app, I have three related models. 

1. QuestionCapacityValue(attributes: value-integerfield, foreign key related to both capacity and a fourth model called Question - that includes the question information)
2. UserCapacityValue (attributes: user, value field, and category field - foreign key)
3. Capacity (attributes: category_name - char field model)

Each user can have several category values 4/5 in science, 1/5 in English, and the questions are also levelled using comparable values in order to select appropriately personalised questions.

User‚Äôs have an integer value (between 1-5) for each category, and so do the questions themselves.

I need to identify all questions from a given query set of questions where the question_category_value is less than the user_category_value in each of the categories (probably will be 200 categories). What can I put in the filter parenthesis to do this?

759985267390294_1717159168339561,"Using Django, I've built three models: Category, UserCategoryLevel1, and UserCategoryLevel2. There are say 10 Category instances, and both other models include the attribute category=models.ForeignKey(Category, ...), and user. Additionally, they both have their integer field, representing what level that user is in that category in Level1 for the first model, and Level2 for the second.

Since the user can only progress from Level1 to Level2 once it's completed all sublevels of level1, I need to relate the two, but I can't figure out how. I've added a boolean to level2, and want to turn the default false to true when the user hits a certain level in Level1.

I've tried generating a queryset of UserCategoryLevel1 that filters for the current user, and the requite Level to move to Level 2. That's fine, but surely there is some way to get a queryset of the Category ids associated to this filtered queryset, and use this to then update the second one directly. Or better still, is there someway to update the boolean directly based on the twice removed related model?",Bryn Larkman,,status,,2017-08-22 18:49:48,1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Most people should stop knocking down programming languages. Languages are tools. You wouldn't demean a hammer for not doing the job of a screwdriver. 

Most people knock Node.JS or PHP for the wrong reasons. Complain about node for the fact that you still can have blocking i/o if that is that much of a immediate concern. Complain about 5.6 and how it allows poorly designed code. But for students to knock other students language choices helps no one if you say a comment like ""java sucks lel"".

I've seen lots of stuff posted about blockchain, but it all seems to duplicate the research, development, and work already done on filesystems.

I'm really looking for a technical description here too. The ""more technical"" papers that I have read on it just make it sound like it's just copying existing work already done on filesystems, but limiting operations so that it is basically only using a filesystems as a database. How is blockchain different from the work that's already done and in use? And if it's the same, why limit yourself to a specific set if your use case could benefit from the versatility of the functionality from a modern filesystem?

I'm coming from a systems engineering perspective, so I know a bit about the functionality of filesystems, along with using hashes, or even better in most circumstances, error correcting codes to verify the integrity of data, and the importance of accounting for transactions, especially if you're in a distributed environment. I'm just wondering how blockchain differs from all of this. What is new about it?

The currently accepted solution: basically a file server and a series of wget calls to tarballs.

I'm banging my head against the wall saying to them this problem has already been solved: just spin up a local maven repository. But no one seems to care for that solution. The reason: no one wants to learn how to manage a maven repository. It seems like it would be a hell of a lot more work to write shell scripts for each git repo to fetch it's dependencies (and update them), than it would be to just just write a pom.xml file and be done with it.

I've had a bad time trying to see if a zip or gzip has password protected files. I'm used to DotNetZip to seeing in .net but in Node.js I can't seem to find an equivalent.

I'm able to see if the file is a gzip or a zip by checking the lead bytes but not if they contain encrypted files.

I've tried using the packages unzip, unzip2 and adm-unzip but they just haven't solved my issues.

I'm looking for a pure node.js implementation.

At this point I'm just considering writing my own module to solve my issue.

If so, could you guys answer on the StackOverflow link so the next poor sod could find it on there.

One of my long term goals is to turn the abstraction of computation and logic into something concrete, tangible, visual, physical, so we can all comprehend this subject a little better, and understand that these systems don't have to exist as code or even as electricity.

Here is one such project, where I took the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, and built a mechanical implementation of the algorithm that generates the solution, in the form of 8 binary and 8 ternary mechanical flip-flops. You might be able to figure out why this works by paying attention to the indicators on the right. You can also check out the Wikipedia page for this puzzle, but it's hard to understand (tl;dr counting in binary maps to what moves to make).",David E Lu,David,video,https://www.facebook.com/10155037359703380/videos/10154974961323380,2017-08-09 18:34:12,282,20,3,222,33,26,1,0,0,0

Yes I have participated in a few hackathons and have some public repos on my github. But most of the work that I have done was for a specific company or a research lab and thus most of my repos are 
kept private.

Currently I have 5 sections on my resume: ""education,"" ""employment,"" ""research,"" ""projects,"" and ""other.""

I was wondering if I should get rid of the ""projects"" section that has descriptions of one of my hackathon projects (that I dont think is too impressive at this point) and of a databases class project. Instead, I'd figured if I should simply add a github URL under the ""other"" section. Currently my ""other"" section has miscellaneous lists including Data Structures TA experience and military service.

Should I get rid of the ""projects"" section or should I still keep the section as it shows that I have done things outside of my given responsibilities?

759985267390294_1701604326561712,"[Long post]
Hey everyone, looking for some advice. I have an interview tomorrow for a web developer graduate internship with a company who make websites for various clients. I'm completely self-taught, have been learning mainly front-end web dev for the past few months on freeCodeCamp (HTML, CSS, JS). I've also spent quite a long time on game development, which isn't directly related but I'll bring up anyway. I'm chuffed I got through to interview stage to be honest, and am trying to be as prepared as possible.

I've spent quite a lot of time sorting my portfolio out, and am going to emphasise that I've always got a project on the go (which I do), and also that this is something I've done completely off my back in my spare time. I'm going to be ready to talk them through my code if they want me to. I'm also preparing for the standard interview questions (why do you want to work here, when have you faced a challenge etc). I'm also doing additional research into the company, and am thinking of questions to ask them at the end.

I've asked whether there'll be a coding test, and they've said probably not, but also that there's a small chance there could be - so I'm trying to prep for that too. The job spec listed front and back-end stuff - php/ruby/SQL, as well as HTML, CSS, JS etc, but also said not to be put off if you didn't have all the skills. I imagine any test would be logic-based, rather than language-based, but has anyone had experience with coding tests? I've been doing a lot of practice JavaScript problems.

So generally, ANY advice whatsoever on what to expect in an interview would be great. Like I said, this is an entry level internship, so I expect they would be giving me training on the job if I got it. I know some things about back-end development, but nothing language specific.",Tara Matthew,,status,,2017-08-07 07:04:38,3,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/

Obviously, putting my API key into the CLI to distribute to users is a bad idea. I don't want users to have to get their own API key though, so what I'm doing is writing a server that will handle the queries to the AlphaVantage API and pass them to the user's clients. This server will also handle some data preprocessing and caching. For my other applications, I've usually just cached data in local memory. Due to the magnitude of data in this API, it seems like using a database is a better idea here, and I'm thinking about using something like MongoDB to do the task.

0) I want my CLI to be able to query for company stock data within a certain time frame and time interval, and implementing my own intermediate server to do that seems like the best way to quickly serve that data. Is this a good way to implement it?

1) Considering the number of stock tickers and the intraday, daily, weekly, and monthly queries, each company ticker has >1MB of data according to the API documentation. How should I best account for large amounts of data being cached? How should I get a good estimate for an upper limit to the memory I'll need in production?

2) Initially, the database will be empty. After a company's stock data is queried, it will be stored in the database and subsequent queries will be taken from the database. If the database's data is outdated, it will be refreshed with a new query to the AlphaVantage API. Is this query-on-demand idea a good way to implement this?

3) Is there a better way to achieve my goal? Is MongoDB a good solution for this? Are there better solutions?

Thanks very much for reading. I didn't want to post this question on Stack Overflow due to its general nature and I figured I'd better broad response from experts in this group.",Alvin Lin,API Documentation | Alpha Vantage,link,https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/,2017-07-30 19:21:06,2,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

1) I am not sure what I would like to get more into. I like mobile dev but also like web dev. I also have other smaller interest. I know when I see job positions I mostly see web dev or stuff with c# + unity. Where both I am interested in. I guess I just don't know what I would like to learn more of and/or which will help with a job better (with any type of dev not just what I listed)

2) Semi related to the above topic, I am having problems thinking of a good project to put on my resume that would get peoples attention. Since I don't know what I really want to get into, I am not sure what to do a project one.

Lately I mostly just been practicing my data structures  and Algorithms in my free time.

Any feed back is appreciated and thank you

1. Code reviews are both the best and worst experience ever.  The worst because someone is correcting your code (agh) and the best because it's a 10x better education than school.

2. The ping pong table in the break room is totally fun, even though the other engineers are way better than me :) 

3. Everyone from all levels at Microsoft genuinely wants to help out interns, which is 10/10 cool, and the fact that we're actively working with engineers, PMs, and our manager to make our project a reality is awesome. 

4. Engineers can seem scary at first, but they're actually the nicest people I've ever met.

1. A link to an HH post from this past week that you think is worthy of being called your favourite HH Post of the Week (no comment links; albums must link the original album post and not any specific picture; etc.)

2. (Optional) A wholesome critical evaluation (expressed as explanation, image, reaction video, etc.) of why, how, etc., it's good

Rules:
- If it follows hh code of conduct, posts from subgroups can be posted. (Some subgroups exist because some people don't want most of their stuff here, so don't put that here unless it actually belongs here)
- The post must have been made in this past week
- You have to actually appreciate the post (it's ok if you don't understand it completely or even at all, but you have to think it's cool)
- Discussion kept to the replies seems like a good idea
- However you can be creative about the format
